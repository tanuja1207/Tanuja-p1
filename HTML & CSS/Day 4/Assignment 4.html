  <div class="text-container">
    <p class="left-align">This paragraph is aligned to the left. This is the default alignment in most browsers.</p>
    <p class="center-align">This paragraph is centered. It is aligned in the middle horizontally.</p>
    <p class="right-align">This paragraph is aligned to the right. The text moves toward the right edge.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="note">
    <strong>Note:</strong><br> Justify spreads the text so that it aligns evenly on both the left and right margins, creating a clean edge. <br>Center aligns text in the middle, but leaves uneven edges on both sides.
