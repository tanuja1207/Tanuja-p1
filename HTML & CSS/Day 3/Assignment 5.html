<!--Explain in a comment how only the larger margin is applied due to margin collapsing.-->
<!--The top and bottom margins of blocks are sometimes combined (collapsed) into a single margin whose size is the largest of the individual margins (or just one of them, if they are equal), a behavior known as margin collapsing.-->
